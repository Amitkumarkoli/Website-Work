        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">The Rich History of Madhubani Painting</h2>
        <p>
          Madhubani Painting, also known as Mithila Art, originated in the Mithila region of Bihar, India. This art form is believed to date back to the time of the Ramayana, where it is said that King Janaka commissioned artists to create paintings for his daughter Sita's wedding. Traditionally, women in the villages practiced this art on the walls and floors of their homes to mark festivals and special occasions.

        <p>
          The essence of Madhubani Painting lies in its use of natural materials. Artists use fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks to create stunning patterns and motifs. Natural dyes and pigments derived from plants, flowers, and minerals are used to bring these designs to life. The key motifs include animals, birds, flowers, and geometric patterns, often depicted within complex borders.

          <li>Outline Your Design: Use a fine brush or nib-pen to outline your sketch with black paint or ink.</li>
          <li>Fill in the Colors: Begin filling in the sections with vibrant colors. Traditional Madhubani art often uses bold colors like red, yellow, blue, and green.</li>
          <li>Add Details: Once the main colors are filled in, use finer brushes to add intricate details and patterns within the larger motifs.</li>
          <li>Finish with a Border: Complete your painting with a decorative border, which is a characteristic feature of Madhubani art.</li>
